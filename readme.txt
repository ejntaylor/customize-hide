== Description ==

This works in the backend. Just activate. Then hit Control & Z

Then a search box opens. You can search items from your admin menu and quickly goto that page.

For example, If I want to add a plugin.

I can open up the search box from any page and then write 'Add' - I can then use the keyboard to select the Add Plugins item.
